# Task Manager in Java

I take all of my notes in Obsidian which uses markdown. I wanted to create a task manager in Java that would allow manage my tasks from the terminal while scripting in neovim.

## Features

- Add tasks
- Remove tasks
- List tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- Priority Sorting
- Due Date Sorting
